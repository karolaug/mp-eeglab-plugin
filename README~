1. Authors and copyrights

This EEGLAB plugin was written by Tomasz Spustek, Konrad Kwaśkiewicz, Karol Auguštin and published under the therms
of the GNU General Public License 3.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Appliance

This software implements matching pursuit algorithm to be used in data analysis under EEGLAB toolbox. Program allows a
user to perform calculations and visualize the results. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Usage

To use this software You need:
- Matlab in version 2011a or newer
- Eeglab in version 11_0_4_3b or newer

To install this plugin you need to place its entire directory inside eeglab-directory/plugins/,
where eeglab-directory is a directory in which your eeglab is located.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Functionalities

After installation you should be able to locate this plugin in the eeglab main menu under Tools > Matching Pursuit analysis.
This software consists of three direct functionalities:

- Calculate MP (mp_calc.m) - carry out the Matching Pursuit procedure and gives EEG.book structure as an output.
Requires several parameters as an input (check doc string for details). Access by pop_mp_calc.m - recommended.

- View time-frequency maps (view_mp_maps.m) - plots reconstruction of a given signal (by means of MP resulting functions)
and its representation in time-frequency domain. Requires EEG.book structure.

- Inspect resulting dacomposition (view_mp_atoms.m) - plots comparison of original signal and its reconstruction. Requires
EEG.book structure.

5. Matching Pursuit Algorithm

The Matching Pursuit algorithm (MP), first proposed by Mallat and Zhang (1993), decomposes a signal into a linear
combination of functions selected form a predefined set of function — the dictionary D. The dictionary is
usually constructed from well behaving functions (well localized in time-frequency space), and usually is
redundant as compared to a base spanning the signal space. MP has the desired property of explaining
the signal in terms of time-frequency localized structures, and due to the redundancy of the dictionary,
the explanation is very flexible.
